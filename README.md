# Optimizing-payment-conversion-rates-with-contextual-multi-armed-bandits

Example DataFrame Structure
Assume our DataFrame contains the following columns:

transaction_id: Unique identifier for each transaction. 
user_id: Unique identifier for each user.
timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
transaction_amount: The amount of the transaction.
payment_method: The method used for payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal, etc.).
device_type: The type of device used (e.g., mobile, desktop).
location: User's location (e.g., city or country).
previous_transactions: Number of previous transactions by the user.
is_successful: Whether the transaction was successful (1 for successful, 0 for failed).



In this updated implementation, the actions array holds the actual action taken for each transaction during training. The algorithm updates its models based on these actions. When handling new transactions, the algorithm chooses the best strategy based on the context, and after observing the reward, it updates the model accordingly. This way, the Epsilon-Greedy algorithm learns which strategies work best in different contexts to optimize payment conversion rates.
